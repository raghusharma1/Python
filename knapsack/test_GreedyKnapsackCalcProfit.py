Scenario 1: Test with valid inputs where max_weight is less than the total available weight.
Details:
  TestName: test_calc_profit_valid_inputs_max_weight_less_than_total_weight
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly calculates the maximum profit when the maximum weight is less than the total available weight.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare profits, weights and max_weight where max_weight is less than the total available weight.
  Act: Call the function calc_profit with the prepared inputs.
  Assert: Check that the result matches the expected maximum profit.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles a common scenario and returns the correct maximum profit. The result is vital for the business to maximize profit.

Scenario 2: Test with valid inputs where max_weight is equal to the total available weight.
Details:
  TestName: test_calc_profit_valid_inputs_max_weight_equal_total_weight
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly calculates the maximum profit when the maximum weight is equal to the total available weight.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare profits, weights and max_weight where max_weight is equal to the total available weight.
  Act: Call the function calc_profit with the prepared inputs.
  Assert: Check that the result matches the expected maximum profit.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles a scenario where the maximum weight allowed is exactly equal to the total available weight. The result is important for the business to know the maximum profit they can make in this situation.

Scenario 3: Test with profit and weight lists of unequal lengths.
Details:
  TestName: test_calc_profit_unequal_length_profit_weight
  Description: This test verifies that the function raises an error when the profit and weight lists are of unequal lengths.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare profits and weights lists of unequal lengths.
  Act: Call the function calc_profit with the prepared inputs.
  Assert: Check that a ValueError is raised.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly checks the input and raises an error when the profit and weight lists are of unequal lengths. This error handling is important for the function's robustness.

Scenario 4: Test with negative values in the profit list.
Details:
  TestName: test_calc_profit_negative_profit
  Description: This test verifies that the function raises an error when there are negative values in the profit list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a profits list that includes negative values.
  Act: Call the function calc_profit with the prepared inputs.
  Assert: Check that a ValueError is raised.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly checks the input and raises an error when there are negative values in the profit list. This error handling is important for the function's robustness.

Scenario 5: Test with negative values in the weight list.
Details:
  TestName: test_calc_profit_negative_weight
  Description: This test verifies that the function raises an error when there are negative values in the weight list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a weights list that includes negative values.
  Act: Call the function calc_profit with the prepared inputs.
  Assert: Check that a ValueError is raised.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly checks the input and raises an error when there are negative values in the weight list. This error handling is important for the function's robustness.

Scenario 6: Test with max_weight equal to zero.
Details:
  TestName: test_calc_profit_zero_max_weight
  Description: This test verifies that the function raises an error when max_weight is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a max_weight of zero.
  Act: Call the function calc_profit with the prepared inputs.
  Assert: Check that a ValueError is raised.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly checks the input and raises an error when max_weight is zero. This error handling is important for the function's robustness.
