Scenario 1: Test with positive weights and values
Details:
  TestName: test_knapsack_positive_weights_values
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correctness of the function when given positive weights and values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize weights and values with positive integers, number_of_items with the length of weights/values, max_weight with a positive integer, and index with 0.
  Act: Call the function knapsack with the prepared parameters.
  Assert: The function should return the maximum gain that can be achieved with the given weights and values.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks the basic functionality of the knapsack function with typical inputs. The expected result aligns with the function's specification of returning the maximum gain.

Scenario 2: Test with zero max_weight
Details:
  TestName: test_knapsack_zero_max_weight
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when max_weight is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize weights and values with any positive integers, number_of_items with the length of weights/values, max_weight with 0, and index with 0.
  Act: Call the function knapsack with the prepared parameters.
  Assert: The function should return 0 as no item can be picked due to the zero max_weight.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks if the function correctly handles the edge case where max_weight is zero. The expected result aligns with the function's specification and business requirement of not exceeding the max_weight.

Scenario 3: Test with empty weights and values
Details:
  TestName: test_knapsack_empty_weights_values
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when weights and values are empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize weights and values as empty lists, number_of_items with 0, max_weight with any positive integer, and index with 0.
  Act: Call the function knapsack with the prepared parameters.
  Assert: The function should return 0 as there are no items to pick from.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks if the function correctly handles the edge case where no items are available. The expected result aligns with the function's specification and business requirement of returning the maximum gain, which is zero in this case.

Scenario 4: Test with weights greater than max_weight
Details:
  TestName: test_knapsack_weights_greater_than_max_weight
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when all weights are greater than max_weight.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize weights with integers greater than a chosen max_weight, values with any positive integers, number_of_items with the length of weights/values, max_weight with a positive integer less than any weight, and index with 0.
  Act: Call the function knapsack with the prepared parameters.
  Assert: The function should return 0 as no item can be picked due to the weights being greater than max_weight.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks if the function correctly handles the case where all weights exceed max_weight. The expected result aligns with the function's specification and business requirement of not exceeding the max_weight.
