```
Scenario 1: Test with positive weights and values
Details:
  TestName: test_positive_weights_and_values
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly calculates the maximum expected gain when given lists of positive weights and values. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize weights as [1, 2, 3], values as [4, 5, 6], number_of_items as 3, max_weight as 5, and index as 0.
  Act: Call knapsack(weights, values, number_of_items, max_weight, index).
  Assert: The expected outcome is 9, as the maximum gain can be obtained by picking the second and third items.
Validation:
  This test is important because it covers the typical usage of the function, where all weights and values are positive. The expected result is consistent with the function's specification that it should return the maximum expected gain.

Scenario 2: Test with zero max_weight
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_max_weight
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly handles the case where max_weight is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize weights as [1, 2, 3], values as [4, 5, 6], number_of_items as 3, max_weight as 0, and index as 0.
  Act: Call knapsack(weights, values, number_of_items, max_weight, index).
  Assert: The expected outcome is 0, as no items can be picked when max_weight is zero.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks the function's behavior in an edge case. The expected result is consistent with the function's specification and the constraint that the total weight of the picked items should not exceed max_weight.

Scenario 3: Test with weights larger than max_weight
Details:
  TestName: test_weights_larger_than_max_weight
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly handles the case where all weights are larger than max_weight.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize weights as [6, 7, 8], values as [1, 2, 3], number_of_items as 3, max_weight as 5, and index as 0.
  Act: Call knapsack(weights, values, number_of_items, max_weight, index).
  Assert: The expected outcome is 0, as no items can be picked when all weights exceed max_weight.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks the function's behavior in a situation where it is impossible to pick any items. The expected result is consistent with the function's specification and the constraint that the total weight of the picked items should not exceed max_weight.

Scenario 4: Test with number_of_items less than the length of weights and values
Details:
  TestName: test_number_of_items_less_than_list_length
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly handles the case where number_of_items is less than the length of weights and values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize weights as [1, 2, 3, 4], values as [4, 5, 6, 7], number_of_items as 3, max_weight as 6, and index as 0.
  Act: Call knapsack(weights, values, number_of_items, max_weight, index).
  Assert: The expected outcome is 11, as the maximum gain can be obtained by picking the second and third items.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks the function's behavior when number_of_items does not match the length of weights and values. The expected result is consistent with the function's specification that it should consider only the first number_of_items items.
