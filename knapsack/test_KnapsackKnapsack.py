Scenario 1: Test with valid capacity, weights and values
Details:
  TestName: test_knapsack_valid_inputs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correctness of the knapsack function when given valid inputs. This includes a positive integer capacity, and lists of weights and values of equal length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a capacity of 50, weights of [10, 20, 30], and values of [60, 100, 120].
  Act: Invoke the knapsack function with these parameters.
  Assert: The expected output is 220, as the weights of 20 and 30 (with values 100 and 120 respectively) can be included in the capacity.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important as it checks the basic functionality of the function. The expectation is based on the requirement that the function should return the maximum possible sum of values that can be included within the given capacity.

Scenario 2: Test with capacity being zero
Details:
  TestName: test_knapsack_zero_capacity
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the function when the capacity is zero. In this case, no items can be included, so the function should return 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a capacity of 0, weights of [10, 20, 30], and values of [60, 100, 120].
  Act: Invoke the knapsack function with these parameters.
  Assert: The expected output is 0, as no items can be included in the capacity.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important as it checks the function's handling of edge cases. The expectation is based on the requirement that the function should return 0 when the capacity is 0.

Scenario 3: Test with all weights being greater than the capacity
Details:
  TestName: test_knapsack_all_weights_greater
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the function when all item weights are greater than the capacity. In this case, no items can be included, so the function should return 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a capacity of 10, weights of [20, 30, 40], and values of [60, 100, 120].
  Act: Invoke the knapsack function with these parameters.
  Assert: The expected output is 0, as no items can be included in the capacity due to their weight.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important as it checks the function's handling of scenarios where no items can be included due to their weight. The expectation is based on the requirement that the function should return 0 in such cases.

Scenario 4: Test with one item exactly fitting the capacity
Details:
  TestName: test_knapsack_one_item_fitting
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the function when exactly one item's weight equals the capacity. The function should return the value of this item.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a capacity of 20, weights of [10, 20, 30], and values of [60, 100, 120].
  Act: Invoke the knapsack function with these parameters.
  Assert: The expected output is 100, as only the item with weight 20 can be included in the capacity.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important as it checks the function's ability to correctly identify and include the item that exactly fits the capacity. The expectation is based on the requirement that the function should return the maximum possible sum of values that can be included within the given capacity.
