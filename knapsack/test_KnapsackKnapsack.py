Scenario 1: Test for optimal solution with perfect capacity match
Details:
  TestName: test_optimal_solution_with_perfect_capacity_match
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function returns the maximum value when the sum of weights perfectly matches the capacity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize capacity as 50, weights as [10, 20, 30] and values as [60, 100, 120]. Set counter as the length of values.
  Act: Call the function knapsack with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: The expected outcome is 220 and it will be checked by comparing it with the function's return value.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly calculates the maximum value when the weights perfectly fit the capacity. It is a basic requirement for a knapsack problem solution.

Scenario 2: Test for optimal solution with partial capacity match
Details:
  TestName: test_optimal_solution_with_partial_capacity_match
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function returns the maximum value when the sum of weights is less than the capacity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize capacity as 50, weights as [10, 20] and values as [60, 100]. Set counter as the length of values.
  Act: Call the function knapsack with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: The expected outcome is 160 and it will be checked by comparing it with the function's return value.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly calculates the maximum value when the weights do not fully utilize the capacity. It is a common scenario in knapsack problems.

Scenario 3: Test for no solution when all weights exceed capacity
Details:
  TestName: test_no_solution_when_all_weights_exceed_capacity
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function returns 0 when all weights exceed the capacity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize capacity as 10, weights as [20, 30, 40] and values as [60, 100, 120]. Set counter as the length of values.
  Act: Call the function knapsack with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: The expected outcome is 0 and it will be checked by comparing it with the function's return value.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly handles the scenario where no weights can be included in the knapsack.

Scenario 4: Test for solution when some weights exceed capacity
Details:
  TestName: test_solution_when_some_weights_exceed_capacity
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function returns the maximum value when some weights exceed the capacity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize capacity as 50, weights as [10, 20, 60] and values as [60, 100, 120]. Set counter as the length of values.
  Act: Call the function knapsack with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: The expected outcome is 160 and it will be checked by comparing it with the function's return value.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly discards weights that exceed capacity while maximizing the total value.
