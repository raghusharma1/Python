ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=bin_to_hexadecimal_a360b20701

Below are the test scenarios for the function `bin_to_hexadecimal`. These scenarios aim to validate the business logic encapsulated in the function and analyze its behavior under different conditions.

---

Scenario 1: Convert a valid binary string to its hexadecimal equivalent
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_binary_string_conversion
  Description: Verify that a binary string input is correctly converted to the expected hexadecimal string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a valid binary string, e.g., "1101".
  Act: Invoke `bin_to_hexadecimal` with the binary string as input.
  Assert: The return value should be the string "D", which is the hexadecimal representation of "1101".
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles basic and valid inputs, which is its primary function.

---

Scenario 2: Handle empty binary string input gracefully
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_binary_string
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when provided with an empty string, ensuring it handles such input correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty binary string.
  Act: Invoke `bin_to_hexadecimal` with the empty string.
  Assert: The function should return an empty string or handle it in a way defined by the specifications.
Validation:
  It's crucial to check how the function deals with edge cases like empty input, as they often uncover unhandled exceptions or logic errors.

---

Scenario 3: Handle binary string with leading zeros
Details:
  TestName: test_leading_zeros_binary_string
  Description: Verify that leading zeros in a binary string do not affect the conversion result to hexadecimal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a binary string with leading zeros, e.g., "00001101".
  Act: Invoke `bin_to_hexadecimal` with the binary string as input.
  Assert: The return value should be "D", ignoring the leading zeros in the conversion.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly ignores leading zeros, which are typically non-significant in numeric conversions.

---

Scenario 4: Handle invalid characters in the binary string
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_characters_in_binary_string
  Description: Verify the function's response to binary strings containing characters other than '0' and '1'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a binary string with invalid characters, e.g., "11012A01".
  Act: Invoke `bin_to_hexadecimal` with the binary string as input.
  Assert: The function should raise an error or handle the input according to defined behavior for invalid strings.
Validation:
  Ensuring robust input validation and error handling is essential for security and reliability of the function.

---

Scenario 5: Convert very large binary strings to hexadecimal
Details:
  TestName: test_large_binary_string_conversion
  Description: Confirm that the function can handle and correctly process large binary strings without performance degradation or errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a large binary string, e.g., 512 bits of '1'.
  Act: Invoke `bin_to_hexadecimal` with this large binary string.
  Assert: Validate the correct hexadecimal representation is returned.
Validation:
  Testing with large inputs checks the function's efficiency and capacity to manage significant data volumes.

---

Each scenario above is crafted to validate distinct aspects of the function's business logic and behavior, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of potential real-world use cases and edge cases. These scenarios together contribute to robust and thorough testing of the `bin_to_hexadecimal` function.
