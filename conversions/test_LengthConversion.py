Here are detailed test scenarios for the `length_conversion` function. These scenarios are focused on validating the business logic of converting between different units of length. Since the function internals and specifics of supported units are not provided, these scenarios rely on commonly used length units and standard conversion logic.

Scenario 1: Convert meters to kilometers
Details:
  TestName: test_conversion_meters_to_kilometers
  Description: Verify the conversion from meters to kilometers is accurate, using a standard conversion rate (1 km = 1000 meters).
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `value` variable to 1000.0 and specify `from_type` as "meter" and `to_type` as "kilometer".
  Act: Invoke `length_conversion(value, from_type, to_type)`.
  Assert: Check that the result equals 1.0.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance by ensuring the conversion between meters and kilometers, which is a typical case scenario for length conversion applications, adheres to standard units and conversion logic.

Scenario 2: Convert centimeters to inches
Details:
  TestName: test_conversion_centimeters_to_inches
  Description: Verify the conversion from centimeters to inches is correct using a precise conversion factor (1 inch = 2.54 cm).
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `value` to 2.54, with `from_type` as "centimeter" and `to_type` as "inch".
  Act: Call `length_conversion(value, from_type, to_type)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be 1.0.
Validation:
  This test is crucial because converting between metric and imperial units, such as centimeters to inches, is a common use case and must be accurate for utility in various practical applications.

Scenario 3: Convert unsupported units
Details:
  TestName: test_conversion_unsupported_units
  Description: Ensure function handles unsupported units gracefully, potentially raising an error or returning a default value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `value` to 100, `from_type` as "furlong", and `to_type` as "parsec".
  Act: Execute `length_conversion(value, from_type, to_type)`.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate error is raised or a specific error message is returned.
Validation:
  Handling unexpected units is critical for robustness, ensuring the function doesn't produce erroneous results or crash when encountering unknown inputs.

Scenario 4: Convert feet to meters with float precision
Details:
  TestName: test_conversion_feet_to_meters_with_precision
  Description: Validate that the conversion from feet to meters maintains precision and accuracy in floating-point arithmetic (1 foot = 0.3048 meters).
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a `value` of 1.0, `from_type` as "foot", and `to_type` as "meter".
  Act: Call `length_conversion(value, from_type, to_type)`.
  Assert: The result should be approximately 0.3048, considering possible floating-point precision errors.
Validation:
  Ensuring precision in floating-point conversions is vital for applications needing precise measurements, such as engineering or scientific computations.

Scenario 5: Convert same units
Details:
  TestName: test_conversion_same_units
  Description: Check that converting with identical `from_type` and `to_type` returns the same value without modification.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose any `value` such as 123.45 and set both `from_type` and `to_type` to "mile".
  Act: Perform the conversion using `length_conversion(value, from_type, to_type)`.
  Assert: Confirm that the result equals 123.45.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function efficiently handles a no-operation scenario, which should not alter the value when the unit type remains unchanged.
